# Machine Learning with R

## Steps used:
*	Loading the dataset
*	Summarizing the dataset 
*	Visualizing the dataset
*	Evaluating algorithms
*	Making predictions

## Standard Dataset Iris
[UCI Machine Learning Repository - Iris](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Iris)

## Creating a validation dataset:
80% of data is used to train models. 20% of data is used as a validation dataset.
Validation dataset is used to know the accuracy of the model obtained through training.

## Summarizing the dataset:
1.	Dimensions: how many rows and columns (instances and attributes)
2.	Types: gives an idea of the types of transforms to use and prepare the data
3.	Levels: Class variable is a factor. Factor has multiple class labels (levels).
4.	Class distribution: number of instances that belong to each class

## Visualizing dataset:
1.	Univariate Plots: plots of each variable. Input attributes(x) and Output attributes(y). 
2.	Multivariate Plots: to know the relationships between the input attributes and the class values
3.	Box and Whisker plots: linear seperations between the classes

## Evaluating Algorithms:

### Creating models and testing their accuracy.

1.	Test-harness is set-up to use 10-fold cross validation
2.	5 different models are built
3.	Best model is selected

### 10-fold cross validation:
Involves splitting the dataset into 10 subsets. Model is trained on other subsets while one subset is held out. Process is completed when accuracy estimate is provided. The algorithmâ€™s accuracy is estimated on the dataset.

Model evaluation metric used is Accuracy. Accuracy is the percentage of correctly classified instances out of all instances.

## Building models:
* Stacking. Building multiple models (typically of differing types) and supervisor model
that learns how to best combine the predictions of the primary models.
5 different stacking algorithms were evaluated.
1.	Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA).
2.	Classification and Regression Trees (CART).
3.	k-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
4.	Support Vector Machines (SVM) with a radial kernel.
5.	Random Forest (RF)
